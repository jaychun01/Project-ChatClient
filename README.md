# Chat Client
## Purpose
This project is one of the project for practicing socket networking and synchronized thread by making server-client chatting program. This java project is to make user chat with application. Also, I used JavaFX to create UI. It was better to create UI than swing component, but coupling of classes is more complicated. I refered several blog to complete project.

When IP address or port number is incorrect. Server owner will notice user. Since I always use laptop, IP Address is changeable.

By practicing I could understand how socket network is working.  

## Things to improve
I want to develop this app to make user chat in separated room. This could be available by making room, and connecting socket by each room.
